### a bot that houses my personal integration bullshit

The point of this bot is to fuck around with slack integrations and Python. Eventually it will end up housing a bunch of personal automation projects, like:

* home nexpose environment
* home splunk alerts
* annoying other people in my slack server

The starting code was cribbed from https://www.fullstackpython.com/blog/build-first-slack-bot-python.html with only minor tweaks.
